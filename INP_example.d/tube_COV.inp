!NUMSPEC -- If /NO/ coverage effects are desired, set lcov=F in tube.inp
10
!Additional options
!BE -- adjusted for binding energy (only important if scaling relations used)
!Model -- 1 for old-style (simple linear), 2 for new-style (two parameter
!  piecewise with threshold coverage), 3 for  three parameter piecewise model:
!  slope #2, boundary point (threshold), slope #1 
!BE    Model
F      1
!Each species block has the following format:
! 'Species/Phase/' n
! where n is the number of lines that follow the format
! 'Species/Phase/' val1 val2
!The first line is the species that is affected by the species on the
!following lines. Subsequent lines have up to two values: the interaction
!parameter val1 (both model types) and possibly a coverage threshold val2
!(model type 2 only). The Species/Phase/ pair should be in quotes.
