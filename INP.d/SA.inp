!This file is used for specifying the parameter distributions for the
!sensitivity analysis. It is only used if lsen=T in tube.inp.
!------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!The following section defines the type of sensitivity analysis and optional
!values used therein.
!type -- Defines the type of sensitivity analysis (/required/). Currently
!        options are
!        0. Off/None (implied by lsen=F in tube.inp)
!        1. FIM-based LSA. This comes for free and does not require any
!           perturbations. It is essentially a time/distance averaged reaction
!           rate. It is complementary to the RPA.
!        2. Brute force local sensitivity analysis. This will solve the model
!           the nominal parameter set plus k additional perturbations, where k
!           is the number of perturbed parameters. Only one cycle is needed.
!        3. Brute force global sensitivity analysis. This is like option (2),
!           but it requires one additional model solution for each replicate,
!           and to be reliable, many replicates are needed. By default, the
!           nominal paremeter set is not used in sampling the parameter space.
!           Instead, two unique points are selected to define the sampling
!           scheme. The sampling scheme follows the radial algorithm of
!           Saltelli and coworkers (/Comp. Phys. Comm./, 2010 & 2011).
!           The sampling algorithm is only correct for statistically
!           independent and/or uncorrelated parameters with identical
!           distribution parameters. An extension to correlated variables
!           was developed by Kucherenko et al. /Comp. Phys. Comm./ 2012, but
!           this has not been implemented in the code.
!        4. Derivative-based global sensitivity analysis. This is like a
!           hybrid of options (2) and (3). It performs a LSA at many points
!           in the parameter space, and then averages them. The method is
!           based on that given by Kucherenko et al. /Rel. Eng. Sys. Safe./,
!           2009. Its main benefit is that all design points can be sampled
!           independently, making it much less expensive for a system with
!           correlated variables than the corresponding variance-based method
!           described in option (3).
!        5. Uncertainty quantification. This is a simple algorithm which
!           chooses a new, independent perturbation point for each cycle.
!        Any of options (3) - (5) may be specified with a negative sign. In
!        this case, the model is /not/ solved, and only the perturbation
!        coordinates are written. This is useful for checking the sampling of
!        the distributions before running expensive GSA calculations.
!The following entries are only used by the global sensitivity analysis. Dummy
!values may be used here if a local sensitivity analysis is requested.
!seed -- 32-bit signed integer. A 0 indicates to use the default defined in the code.
!restart -- Read in previously stored PRNG state?
!runs -- The maximum number of replicates to perform. If this is a restarted
!        calculation, then this number will be reduced based on the previous
!        number of replicates performed. Once it reaches zero an error will be
!        generated, and this value will need to be reset higher.
!output interval -- Write results after this many intervening replicates. This
!                   number must be strictly positive (i.e., larger than 0). A
!                   value of 1 means that output is written at every step.
!new vector on failure -- Should a failed solution result in the immediate
!                         trial of a new design vector (T), or should the
!                         simulation continue on with the current design
!                         vector (F)? This is important for catalyst screening
!                         to ensure the same set of kinetic parameters are used
!                         at every simulation point.
!flush -- flush output after every replicate for GSA (T) or not (F)
!type   seed     restart    runs      output interval   new vector     flush
 2      0        F          5         1                 F              T
!The following is applied to all SA types
!output precision -- How many decimal places to write in tube_w_sen.out and
!                    tube_rate_sen.out for each species concentration or
!                    reaction rate
!fix EA -- whether to fix the activation energies during species property
!          perturbations (T) or fix the transition state energies (F)
!precision   fix EA
8            T
!The following applies only to local sensitivity analyses
!relative perturbation -- Perturb by a fraction of the nominal value (T) or use
!                         one value for all parameters (F). The perturbation
!                         amount is specified as the mean of the distribution.
!                         Perturbations to pre-exponentials are always relative
!                         owing to the use of multiplication by an exponential.

!Parameter types perturbed (these definitions correspond to those in DOE.inp).
!Input formats for each perturbation type. Options requiring an on/off value
!are set via Boolean entry as T/F in the order specified. Error distributions
!for GA, LSR, and BEP estimates are specified in GA.inp, BEP.inp, and
!Scale.inp, respectively. Additional instructions are given in those files.
! NOTES:
!   1. It is currently considered an error to specify both a per-species
!      or per-reaction quantity together with a corresponding correlation.
!      For example, either a species enthalpy or LSR parameter type is
!      allowed, but not both. This is intended to eliminate possible
!      independence issues. This restriction may be revisited at a future date.
!   2. The slopes and intercepts for the BEPs and LSRs are specified together
!      as a single parameter type in the input, but they are treated as
!      separate parameters for the purposes of perturbation. This allows for
!      the calculation of sensitivity indices for the slopes and intercepts
!      separately. At the moment only the LSR slopes are actually perturbed,
!      although this may change later.
! 1 = Species enthalpies (kcal/mol)
!   Line 1 -- 1
!   Line 2 -- types of errors on/off: DFT, GA, LSR
!   Line 3 -- types of constraints on/off: single BE, rxn energy, external MVT
!             If both single BE and rxn energy are /F/, then a non-
!             thermodynamically consistent perturbation of all species
!             energies is performed using the species error distributions.
!             External MVT specifies that the species energies perturbations
!             follow a multivariate t distribution with the distribution
!             parameters specified in mvt_spec_H.inp. The species order
!             for this option is assumed to follow the order of species
!             specified in the species block below. External MVT implies DFT
!             and overrides the BE and rxn energy flags. Local perturbations
!             for the MVT case are still specified on Line 4.

!             follow a multivariate t distribution with the distribution

! 5 = Activation energies (kcal/mol)
!   Line 1 -- 5
!   Line 2 -- types of errors on/off: DFT, BEP, MVN
!             MVN is analogous to MVT above. It indicates activation energies
!             are perturbed according to multivariate normal distributions
!             specified in the file mvn_EA.inp, with different distribution
!             parameters for different homologous series. MVN implies DFT but
!             overrides the values given in line 3. This option also requires
!             that the reactions for this option are specified in mvn_EA.inp.
!             Note that this list overrides the list given below for /all/
!             reaction-oriented parameters (pre-exponential and beta)! As
!             with the species enthalpies and entropies, local perturbations
!             are specified in this block (Line 3).

!The following sections provide a location where species and reactions may be
!listed explicitly as being perturbed. The species should be listed first,
!followed by the reactions. Provisions are made for specifying all, some, or
!none in order to reduce the amount of information entered here. These are
!defined by the value of the first integer:
! -1 -- All species/reactions
!  0 -- No species/reactions
! >0 -- This many species/reaction definitions follow and are listed by name
!These sections work in conjunction with the previous section. That is, if
!a parameter type pertaining to species (reactions) is perturbed, then the
!species (reactions) listed below will be affected. If either the species or
!reaction sections are not needed, they still must appear, but be sure to
!complete them appropriately. NOTE: If the number of species/reactions listed
!is larger than zero, this information is discarded, but the parsing will still
!work as long as the proper number of lines is supplied as the first value.

!The following section is for specifying the basis set for constrained species
!energy/entropy perturbations. Excluding pseudo-species (i.e., vacancies and
!bulk sites) and inerts, the number of basis species needed is equal to the
!number of elements used in those basis species (thus, if C, O, and H appear in
!the adorbates, then three basis set species are required). The first species
!is assumed to be the species which controls the location of the energy zero.
!By modifying this species' energy/entropy, the energies/entropies of all
!remaining species are perturbed according to the energies/entropies of
!reaction. Additional perturbations to the reaction energies/entropies are then
!applied and back-propagated to all other species but the basis species. If
!no species properties are perturbed, this section is skipped.
